Minidumps
=========
These dumps were created using WinDbg and running c:\windows\system32\notepad
and c:\windows\syswow64\notepad.exe.

The dump configurations were based off Chrome's configurations. See
chromium/src/components/crash/app/breakpad_win.cc&l=69 for details.

WinDbg (X86 for 32bit dumps, X64 for 64 bit dumps) commandlines for generating
the dumps:
 - Small type: '.dump /mup <path>'
 - Larger Type: '.dump /mupi <path>'

DLLs and PDBs
=============
These are generated using syzygy/refinery/build_test_types.bat (in a
configuration that must match that of official Chrome).
